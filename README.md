# kanban-console

- KanBan is a console application that is used to manage to-do tasks using the
KanBan way of organizing todo into 3 sections: todo, doing, done. The app
also tracks the time taken on a particular task and displays each task in the
doing and done section with the time-taken so far on the task.
